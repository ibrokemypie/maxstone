				A wireless remote that lets you control your DSLR camera through your iPhone (smartphone) + much more! Let's iPhone your Camera!
				People really obsess with DSLR cameras' photo-quality, but much prefer the intuitive and convenient screen and the operation of an iPhone.
				To fill the gap, we have created the low energy consuming MaxStone. It is so small and simple that even no cable or wire is needed and one battery can last for nearly a year, which means you can take and use it at any time, any place as you wish.

				MaxStone’s wireless remote control controls your cameras, it’s a good tool for time-lapse photography, and even a remote control for video.

				What can MaxStone Do?
				• Firstly, it can wirelessly trigger your camera from up to 100 feet away. Your smartphone will conntect to the MaxStone using Bluetooth, and the Maxstone uses your camera's IR sensor to trigger it.

				• Secondly, it enables your camera to take automatic time-lapsed photos, bulb, and micro-video. You can set custom time lapse intervals (between 1 second and 24 hours) and even customize the exposure time. After you program the MaxStone, even if it loses the connection to your phone it still carries out it's programing to continue operating.

				• Thirdly, you can use the button on the MaxStone to control your smartphone's camera, making it great for taking set-up shots and selfies with your phone.

				• Lastly, you can use it as an anti-loss device. You can use the MaxStone smartphone app to locate your MaxStone and whatever it's tied to. You can make the MaxStone play a loud sound that will help you locate it through it's app. If you get too far from the MaxStone, it even records the time and position you were last closest to it.
